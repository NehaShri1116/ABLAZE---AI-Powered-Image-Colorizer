<p class="lead" style="color:#333;">
    ABLAZE was created with a simple idea in mind — to bring old memories back to life.
    Every family has those faded black-and-white photos tucked away in albums or boxes.
    They belong to moments that mattered… but time slowly drained their color and warmth.
</p>

<p style="color:#333;">
    I wanted to build something that could reignite those memories — something that could
    make a picture from decades ago feel alive again. That is how ABLAZE was born:
    a small project with a big heart.
</p>

<h4 class="fw-bold"> What ABLAZE Does</h4>
<p style="color:#333;">
    ABLAZE takes your old photographs and gently enhances them with realistic colors,
    clearer details, and a more natural look.  
    The goal isn’t to change the memory — it’s to help you experience it the way it
    might have looked back then.
</p>

<ul style="color:#333; font-size:1.05rem;">
    <li>Brings natural color to black-and-white photos</li>
    <li>Improves faded faces and fine details</li>
    <li>Lets you adjust contrast, sharpness, and noise gently</li>
    <li>Shows your before-and-after images side by side</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="fw-bold"> Why I Built It</h4>
<p style="color:#333;">
    Some memories deserve more than to sit in a drawer.  
    A childhood smile, a family gathering, a moment from someone’s past —
    these photos carry stories, emotions, and people we love.
</p>

<p style="color:#333;">
    ABLAZE is my way of helping those moments shine again.  
    Seeing an old photo come alive feels magical every single time.
</p>

<h4 class="fw-bold"> The Heart of ABLAZE</h4>
<p style="color:#333;">
    ABLAZE uses advanced colorization techniques, but at the end of the day,
    it’s not about the technology — it’s about the people, the memories,
    and the feeling you get when a forgotten photo suddenly feels new again.
</p>

<h4 class="fw-bold"> Want to Share Something?</h4>
<p style="color:#333;">
    If you have ideas, suggestions, or just want to share your restored photos,
    I’d genuinely love to hear from you.  
    ABLAZE will keep improving, one memory at a time.
